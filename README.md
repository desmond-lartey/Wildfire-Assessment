## About

The **International Programs Office of the United States Forest Service** is undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the wildland fire situation across Africa. With the increasing demand for wildland fire-related programming worldwide, it's crucial to recognize that Africa is home to the highest proportion of fire-prone ecosystems globally. These assessments aim to provide a holistic understanding of fire on the landscape, its impacts, and the trade-offs of management actions.

## Key Findings

- Africa has the highest portion of fire-prone ecosystems in the world.
- Climate change is leading to warmer, drier conditions.
- Satellite measurements show that Africa accounts for approximately 67% of the global annual burned area.
- The impacts of these fires can be both positive and negative, affecting ecological, economic, and socio-cultural perspectives.

## Assessment Approach

The assessments will follow the **Integrated Fire Management (IFM)** approach. This approach:

- Recognizes fire as a natural and necessary ecological process in many ecosystems.
- Emphasizes the integration of various strategies and tools for effective fire management.
- Aims to minimize negative impacts while promoting positive impacts, such as ecological health and community safety.
- Categorizes IFM activities into five groups: Review and Analysis, Risk Reduction, Readiness, Response, and Recovery.
